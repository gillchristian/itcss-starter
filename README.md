#ITCSS files structure

dead simple starter folders & files structure to organize CSS in a project.

it follows the structure presented in [this great article](http://jordankoschei.com/itcss/) by [Jordan Koschei](http://jordankoschei.com/about/). BTW follow him on twitter [@jordankoschei](https://twitter.com/jordankoschei)

this is a clone-once project, just clone it into your pre/postCSS folder inside your new project, delete `.git/` & `README.md`, and start working :bowtie:
